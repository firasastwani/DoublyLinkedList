# DoublyLinkedList Project

## Overview
This project builds upon the principles of the Singly Linked List by implementing a Doubly Linked List in Java. In addition to having forward pointers, each node in the list also contains a reference to the previous node, enhancing the flexibility of data operations such as reverse traversal and efficient deletion from both ends.

## Features
- **Bidirectional traversal:** Ability to move forwards and backwards through the list.
- **Insertion and deletion:** Elements can be added or removed from both ends of the list or at a specific index.
- **Tail pointer:** Added support for managing a tail pointer to ensure optimized operations for certain use cases.
- **Efficiency:** Efficient handling of edge cases, such as empty lists and lists with one element.

## Key Concepts
- **Prev and next pointers:** Mastery of bidirectional pointer management, ensuring list integrity during complex operations.
- **Memory allocation:** Careful handling of node references to avoid memory leaks and maintain stability.
- **Algorithmic trade-offs:** Improved efficiency over Singly Linked Lists for certain operations, like reverse traversal and element removal.
